# Coding exercises to stay in shape.

Click [here to see the exercises list](exercises.md).

A reference implementation in C++11 is provided for most exercises and conveniently linked from the exercises list.

NOTE: I strongly recommend you trying your own solution before peeking at the ones provided. Missing implementations are constantly being added so, please, be patient.

There are no guarantees that the provided implementations are optimal, but there's a good chance they are at least widely accepted as good. Bear in mind that different scenarios may have a different concept of an optimal implementation.

If you find a better solution regarding usage of resources and real-world applicability, not style (better Big-O for speed and/or memory, lower constant time overhead, better use of locality of reference, improved generality...) then, please, report it in the Issues section (any contributions must be made under the licensing chosen by this project, so keep it in mind).
